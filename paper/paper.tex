\subsection{A short introduction to landscape
ecology}\label{sec:landscape_ecology}}

Landscape ecology focuses on how ecological processes are influenced and
modified by the heterogeneous landscapes they occur in and
simultaneously how the ecological processes themselves influence the
landscapes \cite{Turner1989,Turner2005,With2019}. In this context,
landscape ecology considers, besides others, i) spatial and temporal
dynamics of heterogeneous landscapes, ii) interactions, fluxes and
exchange within these landscapes, iii) how the landscapes influence
ecological processes (and vice versa) and lastly iv) how to manage these
heterogeneous landscapes \cite{Risser1984,Turner1989}.

While human activities have altered the landscapes for millennials
\cite{Ellis2011,Ellis2015}, in the past centuries the effects of humans
on landscapes have increased to an unknown high, known as the the
Anthropocene \cite{Crutzen2002}. Today, almost all landscapes are
directly or indirectly influenced by human activities
\cite{Vitousek1997}. Thus, understanding the complex interactions
between landscapes and ecological processes becomes increasingly
important \cite{With2019}.

Because landscapes are defined as mosaics of different land covers,
ecosystems, habitat types, or land uses
\cite{Forman1986,Forman1995,Wiens1995}, spatial context is important and
ecological processes will vary spatially \cite{With2019}. Thus, in
contrast to many other sub-disciplines of ecology, landscape ecology
emphasizes spatial patterns to a high degree \cite{Risser1984}.
Consequently, the field of landscape ecology relies on tools to
preprocess, modify, model, analyze and visualize spatial data.

\hypertarget{sec:open_source}{%
\subsection{Open-source software and R}\label{sec:open_source}}

Open-source software includes all software which is released under a
license that allows to freely use, modify and distribute the software
\cite{St.Laurent2008}. Open-source software development has many
advantages, such as fast innovation, transparency and reliability as
well as longevity mainly due to many diverse contributors
\cite{vonKrogh2006,St.Laurent2008}.

One example of a successful open-source project is the \emph{R}
programming language and its \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network}
(CRAN) for extensions (also called packages) \cite{RCoreTeam2019}.
Firstly introduced in 1995 \cite{Smith2016}, today the programming
language is among the most popular programming languages, especially in
ecology \cite{Lai2019}. Originally introduced as a statistical
programming language, a growing body of packages designed to analyze
spatial data subsequently emerged for the \emph{R} programming language
\cite{Bivand2006}. This is documented by the growing \emph{CRAN Task
View: Analysis of Spatial Data} \cite{Bivand2019a} and \emph{CRAN Task
View: Handling and Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Data} \cite{Pebesma2020}
with currently almost 300 packages in total. The growing popularity of
the \emph{R} programming language for spatial data analysis and
landscape ecology can also be seen by the increasing number of related
textbooks \cite{Fletcher2019,Lovelace2019,Pebesma2019a}.

Even though many other open-source tools for landscape ecology exist
\cite{Baker1992,QGISDevelopmentTeam2016,Porta2017}, in this review we
are going to focus on tools implemented in the \emph{R} programming
language. For more general overviews see
e.g.~\cite{Jolma2008,Steiniger2009,Steiniger2009a,Istvan2012}.
Therefore, in the first part we are going to try to give a comprehensive
overview over existing \emph{R} packages for landscape ecology. In the
second part, we will identify topics for which \emph{R} packages are
currently missing to the best of our knowledge.

\hypertarget{sec:landscape_metrics}{%
\paragraph{Landscape metrics}\label{sec:landscape_metrics}}

One of the most fundamental steps of landscape ecology is to describe
and quantify landscape characteristics \cite{Turner2005,Lausch2015}. For
discrete land cover classes the composition (number and abundance) and
configuration (spatial arrangement) of the landscape is often described
using landscape metrics
\cite{Gustafson1998,Uuemaa2009,Uuemaa2013,Gustafson2019}. These metrics
allow to compare different landscapes, quantify temporal and spatial
landscape changes and investigate interactions between landscape
characteristics and ecological processes \cite{Uuemaa2009}.

The use of landscape metrics was heavily facilitated by the introduction
of the \emph{FRAGSTATS} software \cite{McGarigal2012}, firstly published
in 1995 \cite{Kupfer2012,Gustafson2019}. However, \emph{FRAGSTATS} is
not not open-source software (however it is free to download at the
developers' homepage), which restricts transparency and reproducibility.
To provide a truly open-source solution to calculate landscape metrics,
recently the \emph{landscapemetrics} package \cite{Hesselbarth2019a} was
developed. The package allows to calculate the most widely used
landscape metrics in a transparent and reproducible workflow within the
\emph{R} environment.

\hypertarget{sec:SDM}{%
\paragraph{Species distribution modeling}\label{sec:SDM}}

Species distribution modeling (SDM) analysis how landscape patterns
(e.g.~habitat suitability, resources availability, etc.) influence and
determine the patterns of species distribution, mainly to infer
ecological processes and predict future species distributions
\cite{Wiersma2011}. Originated in the 1970s, SDM has experienced
numerous methodological advancement and a numerous body of literature
exists today \cite{Zimmermann2010}. Additionally, textbooks introducing
basic concepts of SDM in R exists \cite{Guisan2017,Fletcher2019}.

Because the used modeling approaches are diverse
\cite{Hooten2011,Kerr2011,Fletcher2019}, there is also a large number of
\emph{R} packages used for SDMs. Popular approaches and packages include
generalized linear models using e.g.~the \emph{stats} package;
generalized additive models using e.g.the \emph{mgcv} or \emph{lme4}
package; classification and regression trees (CART) using e.g.~the
\emph{rpart}, \emph{randomForest} or \emph{ranger} package or
multivariate data analysis using e.g.~the \emph{ade4} package. Another
widely used SDM approach uses the concept of maximum entropy
\cite{Phillips2006,Fletcher2019}. However, currently the \emph{maxent}
package is not available on \emph{CRAN} anymore. Of course, also
packages specifically designed for SDM exists. This includes the
\emph{dismo}, \emph{sdm}, \emph{ecospat}, \emph{biomod2} and
\emph{PresenceAbsence} packages.

\hypertarget{sec:landscape_genetics}{%
\paragraph{Landscape genetics}\label{sec:landscape_genetics}}

Landscape genetics investigates how characteristics of landscapes
interact with gene flow, genetic drift and selection \cite{Manel2003}.
Such insights improve our understanding of metapopulation dynamics,
speciation, species' distributions and conservation \cite{Storfer2007}.
By explicitly including characteristics of landscape, landscape genetics
is a way more realistic way of analysis than e.g.~metapopulation
genetics \cite{Holderegger2006}. As a result of its interdisciplinary,
landscape genetics combines methods from different disciplines including
landscape ecology, spatial statistics, geography and population genetics
\cite{Storfer2007}.
