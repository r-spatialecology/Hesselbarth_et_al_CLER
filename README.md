# Open source landscape ecology tools

A manuscript in a preparation for the [Current Landscape Ecology Reports](https://www.springer.com/journal/40823) journal, the section on [Methodological Developments in Landscape Ecology]( https://link.springer.com/journal/40823/topicalCollection/AC_2a02c55cb66acabe5a7301b9bd93b3a5/page/1).
It is a review about open source tools for landscape ecology (with a fairly healthy dose of the toolset we have created in R).
